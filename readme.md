# WhatsApp-Image-Popper (WIP)
A few months before building this app, I created a web-based tool called WhatsApp-Image-Popper ([learn more](https://github.com/PowerPizza/XAHU-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#whatsapp-image-popper)). At that time, users had to log in, upload images manually, and access the tool through the website—even on Android devices.

The web version worked well, but I was also learning Android development. So I thought, why not turn this tool into a native Android app?

That’s how the WhatsApp-Image-Popper Android app was developed—bringing the same functionality in a smoother, faster, and more mobile-friendly way.

This repository contains source code of this android application.
